# netflix-carousel-css-only

This was originally based on the code from [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/b--q6Fsf_cA), cloning the Netflix carousel UI using CSS only.

This version uses radio buttons, and keeps all the items in the same `ol`. There are also custom properties to make it easier to change how many items show per "page".
